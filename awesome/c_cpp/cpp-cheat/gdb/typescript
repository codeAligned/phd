[1mDESCRIPTION[0m[m
     [1mscript[0m makes a typescript of everything printed on your terminal.  It is useful for students who need a hardcopy record of an interactive session as proof of an assignment, as the type‐[m
     script file can be printed out later with lpr(1).[m
[m
     If the argument [4mfile[24m is given, [1mscript[0m saves all dialogue in [4mfile[24m.  If no file name is given, the typescript is saved in the file [4mtypescript[24m.[m
[m
     Options:[m
[m
     [1m-a,[0m [1m--append[0m[m
             Append the output to [4mfile[24m or [4mtypescript[24m, retaining the prior contents.[m
[m
     [1m-c,[0m [1m--command[0m [4mcommand[24m[m
             Run the [4mcommand[24m rather than an interactive shell.  This makes it easy for a script to capture the output of a program that behaves differently when its stdout is not a tty.[m
[m
     [1m-e,[0m [1m--return[0m[m
             Return the exit code of the child process.  Uses the same format as bash termination on signal termination exit code is 128+n.[m
[m
     [1m-f,[0m [1m--flush[0m[m
             Flush output after each write.  This is nice for telecooperation: one person does `mkfifo foo; script -f foo', and another can supervise real-time what is being done using `cat[m
             foo'.[m
[m
     [1m--force[0m[m
             Allow the default output destination, i.e. the typescript file, to be a hard or symbolic link.  The command will follow a symbolic link.[m
[m
     [1m-q,[0m [1m--quiet[0m[m
             Be quiet.[m
[m
     [1m-t,[0m [1m--timing[0m[=[4mfile[24m][m
             Output timing data to standard error, or to [4mfile[24m when given.  This data contains two fields, separated by a space.  The first field indicates how much time elapsed since the previ‐[m
             ous output.  The second field indicates how many characters were output this time.  This information can be used to replay typescripts with realistic typing and output delays.[m
[m
     [1m-V,[0m [1m--version[0m[m
             Output version information and exit.[m
[m
     [1m-h,[0m [1m--help[0m[m
             Output help and exit.[m
