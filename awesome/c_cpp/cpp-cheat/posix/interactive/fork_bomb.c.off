# Fork bomb

    **SAVE ALL DATA BEFORE DOING THIS!!!**

    Time to have some destructive fun and test the limits
    of how many processes the system can have.

    This will try generate an infinite number of processes.
    Each one will sleep and terminate.

    My computer bogged down and I could do nothing about it
    except turn off the power.
