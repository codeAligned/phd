! Note: this subroutine is functionally equivalent with subroutine
! "GRAPH" used in the mainframe program version or in previous PC
! versions. The subroutine call is identical and the program reads
! the same input files according to the same formats. This version,
! however, passes its in information to a completely different
! subroutine PLOTGR, which uses HALO routines to create graphical
! plots rather than print plots. The call to PLOTGR therefore is NOT
! the same as in other program versions!!
!
!
! Check if HALO device drivers are available. If not, print a message
! (once) and exit without calling PLOTGR.
