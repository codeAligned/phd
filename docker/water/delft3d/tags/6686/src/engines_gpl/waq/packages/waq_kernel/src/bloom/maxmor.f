! Compute the mortality of each phytoplankton type, the total biomass

! extinction of living phytoplankton and detritus.
! The new, minimum biomass levels are stored in B2 AND in the original
! X-vector. This is to enable the program to deal with infeasible
! solutions.

!  Update nov 4 1992: don't divide by SDMIX. Questionable for species
!  with buoyancy regulation; definitaly incorrect for species at the
!  bottom.
