! Integer function to obtain the datatype of a character.
! Notice that numbers in exponential notation such as 2.3E3 are
! recognised as valid numerical data by this function.
! DATYPE = 0 for numerical data and 1 otherwise.
! The arguments of this function are similar to the EXEC2 function
! &DATATYPE OF.
