# Coding conventions

## Code formatting

See attached GPUSPH.xml file (exported from eclipse).

(TODO: write rules out explicitly, also suggest vi(m) configuration)

## Naming convention

a. the name of class variable should start with `m_`. Example:

	class foo
	{
		int m_somefoovariable;
	}

b. Host-side pointers should start with `h`, device-side pointers with
`d`. If the host-side pointers are associated with device-side pointers
(e.g. for uploads/downloads) the rest of the name should be the same.
Example:

	class foo
	{
		int *m_hptr;
		int *m_dptr;
	}

c. CUDA Kernels names should end with Device suffix. Example:

	__global__ void calcSomethingDevice(....)

d. Names of classes, functions and variables should be descriptive of
the role of the class, function or variable. Class names should begin
with a capital letter.
