!    Module revision november 1992.
!    Use the TOTAL depth and the TOTAL extinction to compute the
!    growth rate of inhomogeously mixed species. To that purpose
!    "DEP" was added to the parameter list.
!    Corrected (old) error in format 99995.
!
!    Module revision december 1991 and february 1992.
!    Two important modifications:
!    1. All types of a species now have the same KMAX, but a different
!       objective function. (See also BLOOM.FOR).
!    2. Use XINIT for the growth constraint if the total extinction
!       gets too large; NO extra biomass reduction.

!
      IF (ROOT(2) .LE. EXTTOT) THEN
!
!  Kmax {=ROOT(2)} is smaller than the total extinction, indicating that
!  the species cannot maintain its current biomass.
!  We do need the average efficiency
!  EFFI, however, to compute the coefficients for the objective
!  function.
!  When Kmax is negative for a species, its biomass should approach
!  zero as quickly as possible. Therefore put 0.01 in the objective
!  function.
!  Note: do not use a negative number because the mortality constraint
!  of the species could be positive, indicating that it should be
!  included in the final solution.

! whose Kmax < EXTTOT of previous time-step. Normally we might put ANY
! value into the growth constraint as long as it exceeds the energy
! limitation level: the biomass will most likely get energy limited.
! However, as an extra precaution for dealing with infeasible
! solutions put XINIT into the growth constraint: whatever
! is done with the other constraints, this particular type will not
! increase in biomass.
! Check and correct for growth constraints which are lower than the
! mortality constraints.
