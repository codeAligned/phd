!  Calculate respiration rate constants.
!  Calculate the maximum gross growth rate per day as a linear or
!  exponential function of the temperature T.
!  It is assumed that the input function should be incremented with
!  the respiration rate constant. As an option the mortality rate
!  constant can be added as well (LPMORT=1).
!  As another option, Pmax can be set to some small number (BASMOR) if
!  the temperature is below the value stored in TEMLIM.
!  If, however, NREP is 1, the temperature limitation option is ignored
!  because otherwise the model does not have an intial solution for the
!  first time step.
