!  This module determines ALL I/O units for BLOOM II.
!  For historic reasons this subroutine
!  is configured such that BLOOM II units will be number 51 and up,
!  with the exception of units 5 and 6, which are the default console
!  units.

      SUBROUTINE SETUNI
      IMPLICIT REAL*8 (A-H,O-Z)
      INCLUDE 'blmdim.inc'
      INCLUDE 'ioblck.inc'
!
! In ECOLUMN/NZBLOOM version:
!
      IOUX = 50
      DO 10 I = 1, 30
         IOU (I) = I + IOUX
10    CONTINUE
      IOU(5) = 5
      IOU(6) = 6
!
! NZBLOOM: change IOU(10) to 70.
!
      IOU(10) = 70
!
! In ECOLUMN/NZBLOOM version:
!
      IOUX = 40
      DO 20 I = 41, 45
         IOU (I) = I + IOUX
20    CONTINUE
!
! In ECOLUMN/NZBLOOM version:
!
      IOUX = 30
      DO 30 I = 61, 69
         IOU (I) = I + IOUX
30    CONTINUE
!
!  Initialize (old) unit names previously set in various other
!  subroutines of BLOOM II.
!
      INUNI  = IOU(9)

!
! In PC version: use the standard BLOOM II file OUUNI also for EKOBLM
! BLOOM II and DLWQWQ, which use IOU(61), IOU(62), IOU(6) and
! IOU(3).
!
      IOU(61) = OUUNI
