Build instructions: HDF5 and NetCDF4
------------------------------------

This file documents the steps to take for building the NetCDF4 C and
Fortran libraries. As NetCDF4 relies on HDF5, you need to build all
three sets of libraries. The process has been made as simple as
possible, but unfortunately some manual actions are left.


Note on versions
----------------
The instructions below as well as the overall build script assume
the following versions for the NetCDF4 and HDF5 libraries:

NetCDF4-C: 4.3.2
NetCDF4-Fortran: 4.4.1
HDF5: 1.8.16

Other versions, especially newer versions, will most probably work as
well, but sofar they have not been tested.


Prequisites
-----------
LINUX AND WINDOWS:
CMake:
    You need to have CMake 3.1 or later installed. You PATH variable
    needs to include the bin directory for CMake.

    CMake can be found at http://www.cmake.org and can be built with
    a simple procedure or you can get the binaries for your platform.

    For Windows you can download an installer or a zip file at
    https://cmake.org/download

    For Linux you can download a compressed tarball at
    https://cmake.org/download as well.

    Note:
    For Cygwin a separate installation exists - see the Cygwin setup
    program to download and install the Cygwin-specific version.

LINUX:
NetCDF-C 4.3.2: netcdf-4.3.2.tar.gz      (http://www.unidata.ucar.edu)
NetCDF-Fortran 4.4.1: netcdf-fortran-4.4.1.tar.gz
HDF5.1.8.16:  CMake-hdf5-1.8.16.tar.gz (http://www.hdfgroup.org)

WINDOWS:
NetCDF-C 4.3.2: netcdf-4.3.2.zip         (http://www.unidata.ucar.edu)
NetCDF-Fortran 4.4.1: netcdf-fortran-4.4.1.zip
HDF5.1.8.16:  CMake-hdf5-1.8.16.zip    (http://www.hdfgroup.org)

Steps
-----

LINUX:
- Make sure your path includes the C and Fortran compilers of your
  choice.
- Create a separate directory for building everything
- Copy the tar.gz files and the file buildnc.sh into that directory
- Run buildnc.sh

This will take a while, but the result is a complete set of libraries
and module files, found in the subdirectory "lib".

WINDOWS:
- Start a DOS window with the right settings for the Intel Fortran
  compiler and MicroSoft Visual Studio.
- MS Visual Studio can be either VS2012 or VS2013, 32 or 64 bits.
- Create a build directory and copy the zip files into it
  as well as the files "buildnc.bat" and "netcdf-config.cmake.corrected".
- Unpack the zip files

  Note: this is one manual step to do

- Run the batch file "buildnc.bat"

This will take a while, but the result is a complete set of libraries
and module files, found in the subdirectory "lib".

FINAL REMARK:
Refer to either the subdirectory lib in this build directory or copy the
files to a more convenient place. You need the lib subdirectory.
