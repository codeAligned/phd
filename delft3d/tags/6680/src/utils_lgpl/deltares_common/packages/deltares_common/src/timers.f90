!     Created        : February 2008 by Leo Postma
!     Modified       : November 2010 by Leo Postma: a decent call tree in the reporting
!                                                   complete documentation in this source code
!
!     Function       : Handles everything to conveniently time a FORTRAN program
!
!         contains                 meaning
!         timini   ( )           : Should be called once first to initialize. Logical 'timon'
!                                  must be switched to .true. afterwards by the caller !
!         timinc   ( )           : Used internally if the arrays run out of space
!         timstrt(subrou,ihandl) : Starts timing for this subroutine or program part.
!                                  'subrou' is a max. 40 character ID-string.
!                                  'ihandl' must be saved by the caller
!         timstop(ihandl)        : stops timing for this handle and accumulates the result
!         timdump(filename)      : writes the results to the report file 'filename'
!
!     Example:
!
!     *** in the highest level calling program: ***
!
!     use timers                     ! to make the logical 'timon' available  (before implicit none)
!         .......
!     integer(4) ithndl              ! handle to time this subroutine
!     data       ithndl / 0 /
!     call timini ( )
!     timon = .true.
!     call timstrt( "your main program name", ithndl )
!         .......
!     if ( timon ) then
!        call timstop ( ithndl )
!        call timdump ( ifnam(1:index(ifnam,".",.true.)-1)//'-timers.out' )
!     endif                          ! the file name is constructed here from the model file name
!
!     *** in each subroutine: ***
!
!     use timers                     ! to make the logical 'timon' available  (before implicit none)
!         .......
!     integer(4) ithndl              ! handle to time this subroutine
!     integer(4) ithnd2              ! handle to time a critical section of this subroutine
!     data       ithndl / 0 /        ! initialize it to zero for the first call
!     data       ithnd2 / 0 /        ! initialize it to zero for the first call
!     if ( timon ) call timstrt( "your subroutine name", ithndl )
!         .......
!        if ( timon ) call timstrt( "the name of your critical section", ithnd2 )
!         .......
!           timon = .false.
!                 OMP parallel section with subroutine calls that may contain timer calls
!           timon = .true.
!         .......
!        if ( timon ) call timstop ( ithnd2 )    ! here your critical section stops
!         .......
!     if ( timon ) call timstop ( ithndl )
!     return
!     end
!
!     NOTE1: You must take care that you do not leave your subroutine before you close its timer
!
!     NOTE2: There is no maximum to the number of subroutines or program parts that can be timed.
!            The maximum number of times that a timer for the same subroutine / program part
!            can appear in a different call tree (called context) is 99.
!
!     NOTE3: Since the call-tree is introduced, the computation time of a subroutine or program
!            part may be spilt up into parts corresponding to their different location in the call
!            tree. This may result in multiple lines for the same subroutine or program part in the
!            report file. Each line gives the computation time of the subroutine at that location
!            in the call tree. The total time in the subroutine or program part is then not printed.
!
!     NOTE4: You may start a timer with your own explanatory indentification string at any point
!            in your program, you only must take care that always a corresponding stop of the
!            timer occurs. So you are not limited to the timing of whole subroutines only.
!            The ease of use facilitates to easily split up a routine into several parts that are
!            each timed with an own timer to identify bottle necks within a routine.
!
!     NOTE5: Since the use of subroutines is only advantageous if a subroutine is called multiple
!            times, it is more efficient to time your subroutines from inside like in the example
!            above, than from outside in the calling program. An additional advantage of this
!            policy is that the location of your timing commands is limited to the top and the
!            bottom of your subroutine and not somewhere else throughout the code.
!
!     NOTE6: These timers are NOT treadsafe (yet), so always set 'timon' to .false. before you enter an
!            OMP parallel section. You switch timon to .true. after you left the parallel section.
!            (The instructions to switch 'timon' off and on cannot be nested)
!            Furthermore it is assumed that your handles are saved by the program parts, so you
!            must insert the 'save' instruction for the handle if that is not done automatically.
