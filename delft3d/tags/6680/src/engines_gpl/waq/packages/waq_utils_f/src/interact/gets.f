! FORTRAN 77 version of INTERACT routines.
!
! Most functions can be executed normally, as long as CHARACTER*1
! is available.
!
! NOT AVAILABLE: CMS.
!
! Note: CHARACTER and INTEGER variables should be equivalenced in
! several routines. In IBM FORTRAN this is possible, according to ANSI
! standard it is not. To emulate this equivalence, the build-in
! functions "ICHAR" and "CHAR" are used here, WHENEVER one of the
! variables to be equivalenced is changed in one of the programs.
!
! Further note: default delimiters are set in block data according to
! EBDIC ordering. When routines are used on computers using ASCI code,
! a number 1 should be set for elements 33 and 45 of arrays DLM and
! IGN.
