!
!  This module converts some of the inputs of BLOOM II to enable the
!  program to use g/m3 rather than mg/m3 as basic concentration unit.
!  Notes:
!  1. No checks are made that all units are indeed correct! Thus it
!     is the user's responsibility to provide a consistent data set.
!  2. The output formats of BLOOM II are not changed. Thus some
!     numbers of some variables are printed in a rather akward format.
!     It is assumed, however, that ECOLUMN itself will handle all
!     essential BLOOM II outputs in the future.

! Assuming that concentration units in the calling program are g/m3,
! where as BLOOM II uses mg/m3, it is necessary to convert
! 1.  the specific extinction coefficients
! 2.  the carbon to chlorophyll ratio (and hence the dry weight to

! of all phytoplankton types.
! The specific extinction coefficient of detritus.
! The base and top levels of the growth and mortality constraints.
