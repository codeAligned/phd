def cxOrdered(var1, var2):
    """Executes an ordered crossover (OX) on the input
    individuals. The two individuals are modified in place. This crossover
    expects :term:`sequence` individuals of indices, the result for any other
    type of individuals is unpredictable.

    :param var1: The first variable participating in the crossover.
    :param var2: The second variable participating in the crossover.
    :returns: A tuple of two variables.

    Moreover, this crossover generates holes in the input
    individuals. A hole is created when an attribute of an individual is
    between the two crossover points of the other individual. Then it rotates
    the element so that all holes are between the crossover points and fills
    them with the removed elements in order. For more details see
    [Goldberg1989]_.

    This function uses the :func:`~random.sample` function from the python base
    :mod:`random` module.
