    """Executes a simulated binary crossover that modify in-place the input
    individuals. The simulated binary crossover expects :term:`sequence`
    individuals of floating point numbers.

    :param var1: The first variable participating in the crossover.
    :param var2: The second variable participating in the crossover.
    :param eta: Crowding degree of the crossover. A high eta will produce
                children resembling to their parents, while a small eta will
                produce solutions much more different.
    :param low: A value or a :term:`python:sequence` of values that is the lower
                bound of the search space.
    :param up: A value or a :term:`python:sequence` of values that is the upper
               bound of the search space.
    :returns: A tuple of two variables.

    This function uses the :func:`~random.random` function from the python base
    :mod:`random` module.

    .. note::
       This implementation is similar to the one implemented in the
       original NSGA-II C code presented by Deb.
